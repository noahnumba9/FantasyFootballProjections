# Fantasy Football Projections


In this web application I will be showcasing the Defensive Fantasy Point Projections for all 32 NFL teams for the upcoming 2024 NFL season.

# Functionallity

1. I used an array to store & retrieve the data of the top 5 fantasy point teams to display them in my web application.

2. I analyzed the data that was stored in an array object and targeted certian index's in said array to display the data on the "AFC" & "NFC" pages.

3. On the "Rankings" page i used Chart.js and created a bar graph to visualize data of the top 5 fantasy point teams in a friendly way.

4. Last but most important, I retrieved an array object of data of each teams defensive fantasy point porjections from a 3rd party API and displayed that informations in my web application.
