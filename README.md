# Fantasy Football Projections


In this web application I pulled the data of every NFL team's defensive fantasy point projections from a 3rd Party API
then displayed it on the disired page. 

I analyzed the array obejct returned from the API & and targeted certain index's for each 
grouping of teams.

I displayed the teams that finished top five in point projections heading into next season
using Chart.js
